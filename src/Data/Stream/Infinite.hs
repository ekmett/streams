-- | The 'zip' function takes two streams and returns a list of
-- corresponding pairs.
zip :: Stream a -> Stream b -> Stream (a,b)
zip ~(x :> xs) ~(y :> ys) = (x,y) :> zip xs ys

-- | The 'zipWith' function generalizes 'zip'. Rather than tupling

-- | The 'words' function breaks a stream of characters into a
-- stream of words, which were delimited by white space.

-- | The 'lines' function breaks a stream of characters into a list
-- of strings at newline characters. The resulting strings do not
-- contain newlines.
--
-- /Beware/: if the stream of characters @xs@ does not contain

lines :: Stream Char -> Stream String
